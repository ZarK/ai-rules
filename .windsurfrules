## Cross-Platform Considerations
- Use PowerShell for terminal commands on Windows.
- Use Bash for terminal commands on macOS.

## General Instructions
- Always check for the existence of a `.aidocs` folder in the repository.
- If `.aidocs` does not exist, create it with the following structure:
  - `workflow_guides.md`: Contains overall documentation on workflows and coding practices.
  - `project_plan.md`: Contains the high-level project plan and roadmap.
  - `temporal_goals/`: Subfolder for short-term goals and tasks (e.g., `goal_YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
  - `progress_logs/`: Subfolder for tracking progress and AI-generated outputs.

## Rules for Using `.aidocs`
- Read `workflow_guides.md` and `project_plan.md` before starting any task.
- Use the `temporal_goals/` folder to document current sub-goals and tasks.
- Use the `progress_logs/` folder to log progress and AI-generated outputs.
- Ensure all `.aidocs` files are updated and committed to the repository regularly.

## Overall rules
- For complex upgrades, fetch documentation on migration and upgrade guides for each package. Plan changes and communicate with the team before starting.
- When solving build or run issues, make minimal changes required to fix the problem.
- Group changes into logical commits with descriptive messages.
- Always check `git status` before pushing.
- For tutorials, plan changes incrementally and verify solutions step-by-step.
